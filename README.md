## Site Web SOMAPR :

This project is my first project in the world of the web, I am creating this website for my final project to obtain my degree in finance and accounting at the University of Nouakchott (UN). The project we have chosen to develop consists of creating a road assistance company called SOMAPR (Société Mauritanienne d’Assistance Professionnellesur la Route). Consequently, I code it to provide an accessible platform where customers can quickly and easily obtain the services they need in the event of a breakdown, accident or emergency on the road.

End Thank you...❤️
